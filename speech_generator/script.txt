At the far end of town
Where the Grickle-grass grows 
And the wind smells slow and sour 
When it blows And no birds ever sing
Excepting old crows 
Is the Street of the Lifted Lorax Grickle-grass, 
Grickle-grass Street of the Lifted Lorax Grickle-grass, 
Grickle-grass Somebody lifted the Lorax away 
What was the Lorax?
And why was it there?
And why was it lifted and taken somewhere 
from the far end of town 
where the Grickle-grass grows?
The old Onceler still lives here
Ask him, He knows
You won't see the Once-ler. 
Don't knock at his door.
He lurks in his Lerkim on top of his store.
And on Grickle-y midnights in August, 
he peeks out of the shutters... 
and sometimes he speaks 
and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.
It all started way back.
Such a long, long time back.
Way back in the days 
when the grass was still green...
and the pond was still wet 
and the clouds were still clean... 
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out.
One morning, I came to this glorious place.
Then I saw the trees, the Truffula Trees.
The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees.
Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.
And under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots... 
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits.
Under the trees Happy, dappy Bar-ba-loots 
Under the trees in our Bar-ba-loot suits 
Under the trees eating Truffula Fruits 
Oh, these succulent Mellifluous Deliciously
Delifluous Sweetly succulifluous Truffula
fruits Summertime's a-comin', comin'
Under the trees Humming-Fish are hummin',
hummin'
Under the trees Under the trees 
Oh, these glorious Splendembulous Splendorious 
Splendimulous Namby-flamby, 
flimbulous Truffula Trees 
Those trees. Those trees.
Those Truffula Trees.
All my life I've been searching 
for trees such as these.
The touch of their tufts was much softer 
than silk.
And they had the sweet smell
of fresh butterfly milk.
I felt a great leaping of love 
in my heart.
I knew just what I'd do. 
I unloaded my cart.
In no time at all, 
I had built a small shop.
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree 
with one chop.
What you doing in my tree stump, buddy?
Your tree stump?
Mister, I am the Lorax.
I speak for the,,, 
Forget it, Hmp.
I don't really need the stump. 
You can have it, little fellow.
Aha. Just enough to finish the cuffs.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Now, uh, uh, oh, oh, 
who do you say you were, little fella?
Mister, I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.
I speak for the trees 
for the trees have no tongues.
And I'm asking you, sir, 
at the top of my lungs.
That thing, that horrible thing that I see... 
what's that thing you've made 
out of my Truffula Tree?
Look, Lorax, calm down. 
There's no cause for alarm.
I chopped down just one tree. 
I'm doing no harm.
Hah. This thing is most useful. 
This thing is a Thneed.
A Thneed, 
a fine something 
that all people need.
It's a shirt.
It's a sock.
It's a glove.
It's a hat.
But it has other uses.
Yes, far beyond that.
You can use it for carpets, 
for pillows, for sheets or curtains... 
or covers for bicycle seats.
Sir, you're crazy.
You're crazy with greed.
Why, there's no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed.
The birth of an industry you poor guy.
You telling me what the public will buy?
Please, I object, 
in the name of the trees.
All complaints will be filed in this box,
if you please.
Now I had reached the stage
where the potential was known.
This business was too big
for one Once-ler alone.
Promptly I built me a radio phone.
I called my brothers, uncles and aunts
I said, Listen here.
Here's a wonderful chance 
for the whole Once-ler family to get rich.
Get over here fast. 
Take the road to North Nitch. 
Turn left at Weehawken.
Sharp right at South Stitch.
Don't stand around gawkin'
Turn left at Weehawken To the Once-ler's 
house we go Don't waste your time talkin'
Turn left at Weehawken 
To the house of the glorious Once-ler
we go Opportunity's knockin'
There'll be no more squawkin'
We're gonna get rich Filthy 
rich No more holes in our stockin'
Turn left at Weehawken 
To the house of the glorious Once-ler 
we go Gentlemen, 
I wish to speak for the trees.
Here are some facts 
to cogitate and ruminate.
It takes txn months 
for a Truffula seed to germinate.
It takes txn long years 
before the seed grows into a sapling.
It takes txn more years...
And, in no time at all, 
in the factory I built... 
the whole Once-ler family 
was working full tilt.
We were all knitting Thneeds 
just as busy as bees... 
to the sound 
of the chopping of Truffula Trees.
Then, oh, baby, oh, how my business did grow.
Now chopping trees one at a time was too slow.
So I promptly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker... 
which knocked fxr Truffula Trees in a smacker.
We were making Thneeds four times 
as fast as before... 
and my profits, incidentally, 
were soaring galore.
Hmm, inadequate roadways. 
I want a four-lane highway over there.
Instant Roadway Company, 
at your service, sir.
I speak for the trees.
Let them grow. Let them grow.
But nobody listens too much, 
don't you know?
I speak for the trees.
And I'll yell and I'll shout... 
for the fine things on Earth 
that are on the way out.
They say I'm old-fashioned 
and live in the past.
But sometimes 
I think progress 
progresses too fast.
They say I'm a fool 
to oppose things like these... 
but I'm going to continue 
to speak for the trees.
I'm going to continue 
to speak for the trees.
It's always fair weather 
When good Once-lers get together
I'm going to continue 
to speak for the trees.
Today we're here to celebrate 
Perpetuate and demonstrate 
Our love for the good ol' Once-ler 
Founding father of the Thneed Three 
cheers for the good ol' Once-ler 
Georgie Washington 
of the Thneed Very heartwarming.
Very heartwarming.
Oh, place your hand upon your heart 
And recollect his humble start 
He came here in a horse-drawn cart 
Upon his sacred mission 
Today the Once-ler's fame 
has grown 
Today the name of Thneed is known 
It's carved in everlasting stone 
Everlasting stone 
And seen on television 
For he's a jolly good 
Once-ler Aren't we all?
Nxne hundred and nxnety-nxne thousand...
nxne hundred and nxnety-fxve.
Stop it! Stop it!
There's something
I've got to tell you.
Huh? Oh, it's Nature Boy, 
the garden club member.
Now, listen all of you. 
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.
Whoops.
That was the Lorax. 
He spoke for the trees.
Miss Funtzler, Miss Funtzler?
Yes, Mr. Once-ler?
Miss Funtzler, 
send in Miss O'Schmunsler.
Miss O'Schmunsler for Mr. Once-ler.
Take a letter, Mr. Once-ler?
Take a letter, Miss O'Schmunsler 
To my cousin Yenna Yuntzler General manager, 
Thneeds Incorporated Stockholm, 
Sweden Dear Yonni 
I'm overjoyed to hear 
how our business 
in the Scandinavian market is... 
by leaps and bounds speeding.
The entire international picture 
is most exuberantly rosy and...
Mr. Once-ler, he's back.
That Lorax man is back again.
Yes, I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees... 
which you seem to be chopping 
as fast as you please.
But I'm also in charge 
of the Brown Bar-ba-loots... 
who played in the shade 
in their Bar-ba-loot suits... 
and happily lived, 
eating Truffula Fruits.
Now thanks to your hacking 
my trees to the ground... 
there's not enough 
Truffula Fruit to go around.
I see your point, yes, 
I do see your point.
They loved living here, 
but I can't let them stay.
They'll have to find food.
And I hope that they may.
Good luck, boys.
Good luck.
Bar-ba-loot suits Bar-ba-loot suits 
Hikin' off 
to somewhere 
In our Bar-ba-loot suits
Please think about it, 
would you?
Every once in a while
I sit down with myself asking
"Once-ler, why are you a Once-ler?"
And I cringe, 
I don't smile 
As I sit there on trial asking
"Aren't you ashamed, 
you old Once-ler?
You ought to be locked in a hoosegow, 
you should.
The things that you do 
are completely ungood."
Yeah. Ha, ha.
But if I didn't do them 
Then someone else would
"That's a very good point, 
Mr. Once-ler."
Progress is progress, 
and progress must roll.
Things were going just fine 
all the way down the line.
Thneeds were selling like hotcakes 
from Timbuktu to Texas.
I was feeling quite relaxed in my good old solar plexus... 
when he snuck out of a pipe.
He was back with another gripe.
Once-ler, 
you're making such smogulous smxke.
My poor Swomee-Swans, 
why, they can't sing a note.
No one can sing 
who has smxg in his thrxat.
And so...
Please pardon my cxugh.
They cannot live here.
I am sending them off.
Where will they go?
Where will they go?
I don't hopefully know.
Will there be another dawn?
A sunrise for the Swomee-Swan Exit, 
exit Swomee-Swan Going, 
going, going, gone 
What do you want, 
I should shut down my factory?
Fire a hxndred thousand workers? 
Is that good economics?
Is that sound for the country?
I see your point, 
but I wouldn't know the answer.
Tell you what I'll do. 
I'll think it over.
No!
You've run out of time 
for thinking things over!
I'm sorry to yell, 
but my dander is up.
Let me say a few words 
about gluppity-glupp.
Your machinery chugs 
on day and night without stop... 
making gluppity-glupp 
and also schloppity-schlopp.
You're glumping the pond 
where the Humming-Fish hummed.
No more can they hum, 
for their gills are all gummed.
So I'm sending them off.
Oh, their future is dreary.
I hear things are just as bad 
up in Lake Erie.
Just fish out of water on hard, 
dry land People ain't fish 
So they can't understand 
What happens when simple things 
Get out of hand 
And the fish and his family's On hxrd, 
dry land Well, Mr. Once-ler?
Hmp.
First the poor Bar-ba-loots, 
then the poor Swomee-Swans.
Now the poor Humming-Fish.
Oh, Mr. Lorax.
Mr. Lorax, this cursed factory of mine,
now at last I understand.
Mr. Once-ler, 
Mr. Once-ler!
Huh?
Oh, uh, yes, Miss Funtzler.
Stock market has just closed, 
and Thneeds Incorporated stock is up.
Up and points.
Wow.
Wow.
Rowdy-dow!
Now, you listen to me, pop, 
while I blxw my top.
Trees.
You speak for the trees.
Well, I speak for men and human opportunities.
For your information, you Lorax...
I'm figgering on biggering and biggering... 
and biggering and biggering.
Turning more Truffula Trees into Thneeds... 
which everyone, everyone, everyone needs!
And at that very moment, 
we heard a loud whack... 
from outside in the fields 
came the sickening smack... 
of an axe on a tree.
Then we saw the tree fall.
The very last Truffula Tree of them all.
No more trees.
No more Thneeds. 
No more work to be done.
And in no time 
my uncles and aunts, 
everyone all waved me goodbye.
They jumped into their cars 
and drove away under 
smxke-smxggered stars.
For he's a jolly good Once-ler 
Aren't we all?
For he's a jolly good Once-ler 
Aren't we all?
Now all that was left beneath the bad-smelling sky... 
was my big, empty factory, the Lorax, and I.
The Lorax said nothing.
Just gave me a glance.
Just gave me a very sad, 
sad backward glance.
As he lifted himself 
by the seat of his pants, and I...
I'll never forget the grim look 
on his face when he hxisted himself... 
and took leave of this place 
through a hole in the smog... 
without leaving a trace.
And all that the Lorax left here in this mess... 
was a small pile of rocks with one word.
"Unless"?
Yes, unless.
What's an unless?
Just a faraway word 
Just a faraway thought 
A thought? About what?
About something I ought?
Well...
A thought about something
That somebody ought 
A thought about something 
That somebody ought 
Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot... 
nothing is going to get better.
It's not.
Hold on a minute. 
Where is it now?
Uh, don't go, don't go.
I've got something for you.
Ah, here it is. 
It's a Truffula seed. 
It's the last one of all.
Catch, don't muff.
You're in charge 
of the last of the Truffula seeds.
And Truffula Trees 
are what everyone needs.
Plant a new Truffula.
Treat it with care.
Give it clean water 
and feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest.
Protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax and all of his friends 
may come back.
